                  All teams must do a technical presentation about their
                  respective aircraft. The technical presentation must be
                  minimum 5 minutes and maximum 10 minutes long. The
                  participating model aircraft must be present during the
                  technical presentation. A printed copy of the design report
                  must be submitted to the judges before starting the technical
                  presentation.

                <li>Round 2: HEAVY LIFTERS</li>

                  A safety inspection will be conducted by the event
                  coordinators before the flight round.Â  The plane will be
                  loaded with payload(tennis balls). The participant may load as
                  many balls as he deems their aircraft can lift. The plane
                  shall then take off and travel a predefined circuit and drop
                  its payload at the designated payload drop area that will be
                  clearly marked on the ground. Points in this round will be
                  given on the basis of maximum payload lifted and the accuracy
                  of the payload drop.
                </p>
                <li>Round 3: FLY HIGH</li>
                <p>
                  In this round the Pilot shall take the plane to maximum
                  altitude achieved in 20 seconds of upward flight and then cut
                  off the throttle.<br />The timer will start once the throttle
                  is cut. The pilot shall then bring the aircraft down and land
                  without the use of throttle.<br />Â  The timer will be stopped
                  at the moment the aircraft touches the ground. Maximum points
                  will be given to the aircraft with maximum gliding time.<br /><strong>

              mentioned in following rounds with given constraint. The Theme of
              this competition this time is to design and fabricate a glider
              on-site and compete based on Glide time and Glide Distance and
              showcase your aerospace and designing skills. The three teams
              which score the maximum number of points shall win the
              competition. All the material necessary will be provided to build
              the gliders. Why to Participate - For those who find something
              interesting in aircraft but are beginners or short on budget can
              experience the beauty of gliders and try out their skills to
              compete and learn the field of aerodynamics, aircraft structures
              and enjoy the wonderful hobby. A team must design, fabricate, and
              demonstrate a glider which can perform tasks mentioned in

                  Before proceeding to round 1, each team will be provided with building materials for the glider. And they will be provided 90 minutes for fabricating the glider.
                  Teams are advised to use the materials provided appropriately, as the same glider will be used in the 2nd round and teams can choose to modify the glider from the remaining material from the 1st round.

                All teams from round 1 will then participate in the 2nd round.<br/>
                Score - Total points = Glide time in (seconds)</p>
                                                      
                <strong>ROUND 2</strong>

                    Depending on gliding distance, teams will be awarded points.
                    
                    Score - Total points = Glide Distance in (meters)
                    
                    Each Team will be given 3 attempts for both Round 1 and Round 2, best score shall be considered.
